\section*{Limitations}
In event normalization, we only normalize personal words in event as it is the most common spans that worth normalization, normalization of other type of information are not considered, which we leave for future work.
When grounding to event-centric KGs, we consider finding the shortest paths to retrieve the knowledge subgraph due to high computational complexity of solving the Steiner tree problem.
Other retrieval methods (e.g. reinforcement learning based) could also be considered.
