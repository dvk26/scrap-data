As an example of an application of Ip,q beyond the interpretation of wave functions, Ip,q is then used to investigate the ordering problem in the density-matrix renormalization group.}

abstract = {We define a model of quantum computation with local fermionic modes (LFMs)—sites which can be either empty or occupied by a fermion. With the standard correspondence between the Foch space of m LFMs and the Hilbert space of m qubits, simulation of one fermionic gate takes O(m) qubit gates and vice versa. We show that using different encodings, the simulation cost can be reduced to O(log m) and a constant, respectively. Nearest neighbors fermionic gates on a graph of bounded degree can be simulated at a constant cost. A universal set of fermionic gates is found. We also study computation with Majorana fermions which are basically halves of LFMs. Some connection to qubit quantum codes is made.}

@article{Halimeh_2022,
	abstract = {Protection of gauge invariance in experimental realizations of lattice gauge theories based on energy-penalty schemes has recently stimulated impressive efforts both theoretically and in setups of quantum synthetic matter. A major challenge is the reliability of such schemes in non-abelian gauge theories where local conservation laws do not commute. Here, we show through exact diagonalization (ED) that non-abelian gauge invariance can be reliably controlled using gauge-protection terms that energetically stabilize the target gauge sector in Hilbert space, suppressing gauge violations due to unitary gauge-breaking errors. We present analytic arguments that predict a volume-independent protection strength V, which when sufficiently large leads to the emergence of an adjusted gauge theory with the same local gauge symmetry up to least a timescale . Thereafter, a renormalized gauge theory dominates up to a timescale ∝exp(V/V 0)/V 0 with V 0 a volume-independent energy factor, similar to the case of faulty abelian gauge theories. Moreover, we show for certain experimentally relevant errors that single-body protection terms robustly suppress gauge violations up to all accessible evolution times in ED, and demonstrate that the adjusted gauge theory emerges in this case as well. These single-body protection terms can be readily implemented with fewer engineering requirements than the ideal gauge theory itself in current ultracold-atom setups and noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices.},

	abstract = {The accurate evaluation of diagonal unitary operators is often the most resource-intensive element of quantum algorithms such as real-space quantum simulation and Grover search. Efficient circuits have been demonstrated in some cases but generally require ancilla registers, which can dominate the qubit resources. In this paper, we give a simple way to construct efficient circuits for diagonal unitaries without ancillas, using a correspondence between Walsh functions and a basis for diagonal operators. This correspondence reduces the problem of constructing the minimal-depth circuit within a given error tolerance, for an arbitrary diagonal unitary  in the  basis, to that of finding the minimal-length Walsh-series approximation to the function f(x). We apply this approach to the quantum simulation of the classical Eckart barrier problem of quantum chemistry, demonstrating that high-fidelity quantum simulations can be achieved with few qubits and low depth.},

	abstract = {Nuclear processes involving momenta much below the mass of the pion may be described by an effective field theory in which the pions do not appear as explicit degrees of freedom. The effects of the pion and all other virtual hadrons are reproduced by the coefficients of gauge-invariant local operators involving the nucleon field. Nucleon-nucleon scattering phase shift data constrains many of the coefficients that appear in the effective Lagrangean but at some order in the expansion coefficients enter that must be constrained by other observables. We compute several observables in the two-nucleon sector up to next-to-next-to leading order in the effective field theory without pions, or to the order at which a counterterm involving four-nucleon field operators is encountered. Effective range theory is recovered from the effective field theory up to the order where relativistic corrections enter or where four-nucleon-external current local operators arise. For the deuteron magnetic moment, quadrupole moment and the np → dγ radiative capture cross section a four-nucleon-one-photon counterterm exists at next-to-leading order. The electric polarizability and electric charge form factor of the deuteron are determined up to next-to-next-to-leading order, which includes the first appearance of relativistic corrections.},
