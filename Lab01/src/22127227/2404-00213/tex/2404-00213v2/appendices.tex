\section{Prompts}
\label{sec:sampleprompts}
Below is the prompt leveraged for token-based dataset generation. 
\newtcolorbox{myquote}{colback=block-gray,grow to right by=0mm,grow to left by=0mm,boxrule=0pt,boxsep=0pt,breakable}
\begin{myquote}
\textbf{System Prompt:} You are an AI assistant knowledgeable about recent sporting events. Be accurate but concise in response. \\
\textbf{User Prompt:} Please write 10 questions and answers probing the facts and statistics contained in the following snippet from an article about \{theme\}:\textbackslash n\textbackslash n\{passage\}\textbackslash n\textbackslash n1. Q: \{seed\_question\} A: \{question\_bank[seed\_question]\}\textbackslash n2. "
\end{myquote}

The following is the prompt used for atomic fact distillation. 
\begin{myquote}
\textbf{System Prompt:} You are an AI assistant knowledgeable about recent sporting events. Be accurate but concise in response. \\
\textbf{User Prompt:} Please break down the following snippet from an article about \{theme\} into atomic facts.\textbackslash nGoal 1: The atomic facts should be as simple as possible, if it's compound sentence, break down one more time.\textbackslash nGoal 2: For clarity, avoid using pronouns like 'it', 'he', 'she', 'this', 'that' etc., and instead use the full names or titles.\textbackslash n\textbackslash n\{passage\}\textbackslash n\textbackslash n1. 
\end{myquote}

Next is the prompt used for fact-based dataset generation with the skip option present.
\begin{myquote}
\textbf{System Prompt:} You are an AI assistant knowledgeable about recent sporting events. Be accurate but concise in response. \\
\textbf{User Prompt:} Write 10 pairs of questions and answers probing the facts and statistics of a given sentence about \{theme\}.\textbackslash nConsider first generating questions and answers that are very relevant and explicit to the fact, then paraphrase those questions and answers to reach the desired 10 Q\&A pairs. If the fact is too broad or not specific enough to \{theme\}, you may reply with ``SKIP" and be done.\textbackslash nEXAMPLE:\textbackslash nFACT: 14 million viewers tuned in to the opening game of the series.\textbackslash n1. Q: How many viewers watched the first game? A: 14 million people watched the first game of the series.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nEXAMPLE:\textbackslash nFACT: The rose is red.\textbackslash nSKIP\textbackslash n\textbackslash nFACT: \{fact\}\textbackslash n1. "
\end{myquote}

The fact-based dataset generation prompt with the skip option removed is the following:
\begin{myquote}
\textbf{System Prompt:} You are an AI assistant knowledgeable about recent sporting events. Be accurate but concise in response. \\
\textbf{User Prompt:} Write 10 pairs of questions and answers probing the fact and statistics of the below fact about \{theme\}:\textbackslash n\{fact\}\textbackslash n\textbackslash nYou can firstly generate questions and answers that are very relevant and explicit to the fact, and then paraphrase question and answers to reach the desired 10 pairs. \textbackslash n1. Q: sample question A: sample answer \textbackslash n2. 
\end{myquote}
In addition to removing the SKIP part, we found the altered phrasing here made the model more willing to generate Q\&A pairs on more general-sounding facts.

Finally, below is the prompt used for generated answer accuracy:
\begin{myquote}
\textbf{System Prompt:} You are a high school teacher grading student's responses for questions about {theme}. These responses are either correct or incorrect. \\
\textbf{User Prompt:} Please evaluate the correctness of a sentence in answering the question: ``\{question\}". The correct answer is ``\{ref\_answer\}". Your grading is binary: give 0 if the sentence is incorrect, give 1 if the sentence is correct. The sentence is ``\{pred\_answer\}." Please note that your output is either 0 or 1, no other information should be in the output.
\end{myquote}

The themes used in the above prompts are short snippets meant to contextualize each sporting event. For our six datasets, they are ``the 2023 Cricket World Cup", ``the 2018 FIFA World Cup", ``the recent 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup", ``the recent 2023 Superbowl LVII", ``the recent 2023 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball tournament", and ``the recent 2023 PGA Master's Tournament".

\section{Sample Atomic Facts}
\label{sec:atomicfacts}
Below we include 10 reference atomic facts extracted by GPT-4 for each of the six sporting events in this study. \\ \\

    \itemsep0em
    \item Bangladesh qualified for the 2023 Cricket World Cup via the ICC Cricket World Cup Super League.
    \item Teams that did not progress past the league stage of the 2023 Cricket World Cup received \$100,000.
    \item Virat Kohli scored the most runs in the 2023 ICC Men's Cricket World Cup.
    \item Sean Easey is the head of the ICC's umpire selection panel.
    \item India had a 302-run win against Sri Lanka.

    \item Sri Lanka was the only full member to progress from the knock-out qualification stage for the 2023 Cricket World Cup.
\end{itemize} 
2023 PGA Master's Tournament
\begin{itemize}
    \itemsep0em
    \item Brooks Koepka was leading by 4 strokes over Jon Rahm at the time of suspension.
    \item Patrick Cantlay had a round of 68 (4 under par).
    \item Jon Rahm won the 2023 Masters Tournament.
    \item Jon Rahm made three birdies and two bogeys on the back nine to finish at 134 (10 under par).
    \item Phil Mickelson was ten shots back in the 2023 Masters Tournament.
    \item Séamus Power became the fourth player in the event's history to make two holes-in-one in the same year.
    \item Viktor Hovland had no bogeys in his round.
    \item Three trees fell near the 17th tee moments before the second suspension.
    \item Jon Rahm was two under par for his round, three behind Brooks Koepka, when play was suspended on Friday.
    \item Play was suspended for the day at 3:16 pm Eastern time on Saturday, April 8, 2023.
\end{itemize}
2023 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament
\begin{itemize}
    \itemsep0em
    \item California State University, Sacramento was the host at the Golden 1 Center for the first and second rounds of the 2023 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball tournament.
    \item 32 automatic bids were filled by programs that won their conference tournament.
    \item 36 bids were issued ``at-large".
    \item Streaming was available through Paramount+.
    \item The defending national champions Kansas Jayhawks were eliminated in the second round of the 2023 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament.

    \item 16 consecutive tournaments since 2007 have seen a double-digit seed make the regional semifinals.
    \item Westwood One is a company.
    \item Three upsets occurred in the second round of the 2023 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball tournament.
    \item Texas Southern tied the Coppin State Eagles in 2008 and Liberty Flames in 2013 for most losses ever to make the tournament, with 20.
\end{itemize}
Here we make a few observations. The last sample fact in the list concerns pre-cutoff knowledge; indeed, the base model performed the best on the NCAA dataset of the five post-cutoff events, suggesting it had the highest frequency of pre-cutoff facts. Additionally, we can see the fact "Westwood One is a company" is too nonspecific to be new knowledge from the document, meaning this got past our prompt "SKIP" filtering. Spot-checking reveals only a handful of such examples across all six datasets, and we wonder if including a more explicit classification step for filtering post fact candidate generation might be more effective than our previous approach.
