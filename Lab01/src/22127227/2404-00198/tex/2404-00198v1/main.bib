@article{Liu2019,
abstract = {Robust quantum energy storage devices are essential to realize powerful next-generation batteries. Herein, we provide a proof of concept for a loss-free excitonic quantum battery (EQB) by using an open quantum network model that exhibits exchange symmetries linked to its structural topology. By storing electronic excitation energy in a symmetry-protected dark state living in a decoherence-free subspace, one can protect the charged EQB from environment-induced energy losses, thereby making it a promising platform for long-term energy storage. To illustrate the key physical principles and potential functionality of this concept, we consider an open quantum network model of a para-benzene-like structure. We demonstrate through numerical simulations the immunity of the charged EQB to environmentally induced losses and further show how to harness the stored energy by adding a symmetry-breaking perturbation (SBP) to the network. We also investigate the impact of static disorder and temperature fluctuations of the SBP on the performance of the EQB during its storage and discharge phases. Apart from the cases with very strong static disorder, the performance of the EQB is essentially unaltered, thereby demonstrating the robustness of the proposed EQB.},

@article{Davidson2020,
abstract = {We present a novel, counter-intuitive method, based on dark-state protection, for significantly improving exciton transport efficiency through "wires"comprising a chain of molecular sites with an intrinsic energy gradient. Specifically, by introducing "barriers"to the energy landscape at regular intervals along the transport path, we find that undesirable radiative recombination processes are suppressed due to a clear separation of sub-radiant and super-radiant eigenstates in the system. This, in turn, can lead to an improvement in transmitted power by many orders of magnitude, even for very long chains. From there, we analyze the robustness of this phenomenon to changes in both system and environment properties to show that this effect can be beneficial over a range of different thermal and optical environment regimes. Finally, we show that the novel energy landscape presented here may provide a useful foundation for overcoming the short length scales over which exciton diffusion typically occurs in organic photo-voltaics and other nanoscale transport scenarios, thus leading to considerable potential improvements in the efficiency of such devices.},

abstract = {We demonstrate that it is possible to effectively eliminate radiative losses during excitonic energy transport in systems with an intrinsic energy gradient. By considering chainlike systems of repeating "unit" cells that can each consist of multiple sites, we show that tuning a single system parameter (the intra-unit-cell coupling) leads to efficient and highly robust transport over relatively long distances. This remarkable transport performance is shown to originate from a partitioning of the system's eigenstates into energetically separated bright and dark subspaces, allowing long-range transport to proceed efficiently through a "dark chain" of eigenstates. Finally, we discuss the effects of intrinsic dipole moments, which are of particular relevance to molecular architectures, and demonstrate that appropriately aligned dipoles can lead to additional protection against other (nonradiative) loss processes. Our dimensionless open quantum systems model is designed to be broadly applicable to a range of experimental platforms.},

We contrast this collective model (``Dicke QB''), whereby entanglement is genuinely created by the common photonic mode, to the one in which each two-level system is coupled to its own separate cavity mode (``Rabi QB''). By employing exact diagonalization, we demonstrate the emergence of a quantum advantage in the charging power of Dicke QBs, which scales like {$\surd$}N for N{$\gg$}1.},

  abstract = {The formation of hybrid light\textendash matter states in optical structures, manifested as a Rabi splitting of the eigenenergies of a coupled system, is one of the key effects in quantum optics. The hybrid states (exciton polaritons) have unique chemical and physical properties and can be viewed as a linear combination of light and matter. The optical properties of the exciton polaritons are dispersive by nature, a property inherited from the photonic contribution to the polariton. On the other hand, the polariton lifetime in organic molecular systems has recently been highly debated. The photonic contribution to the polariton would suggest a lifetime on the femtosecond time scale, much shorter than experimentally observed. Here, we increase the insights of light\textendash mater states by showing that the polariton emission lifetime is nondispersive. A perylene derivative was strongly coupled to the vacuum field by incorporating the molecule into a Fabry\textendash P\'erot cavity. The polariton emission from the cavity was shown to be dispersive, but the emission lifetime was nondispersive and on the time scale of the bare exciton. The results were rationalized by the exciton reservoir model, giving experimental evidence to currently used theories, thus improving our understanding of strong coupling phenomena in molecules.},

In most cases, the distances for efficient energy transfer are determined by the dimensions of the structure, making dissipation in the metal dominant when long-range energy transfer is desired. Here, we propose and study a new mechanism for long-distance energy transfer, which can lead to highly efficient energy transfer over distances comparable to the optical wavelength, based on hybrid photonic\textendash plasmonic modes in metal-dielectric structures. We study such structures theoretically and characterize the energy-transfer processes in them, showing that within these structures, energy can be funneled with {$\sim$}25\% efficiency over a range of about 150 nm, with minimal dependence on the location of the acceptor molecules inside the structure. Finally, we demonstrate this new mechanism experimentally, providing a proof-of-concept for long-distance energy transfer in such structures. Our multilayer system is compatible with standard photovoltaic and organic light-emitting diodes and therefore the mechanism presented can be readily employed in such organic optoelectronic devices to improve their performance.},

Such energy transfer has previously been explored when thin-films of different molecules are relatively closely spaced ({$\approx$}100 nm). In this manuscript, we explore strong-coupled microcavities in which thin-films of two J-aggregated molecular dyes were separated by a spacer layer having a thickness of up to 2 {$\mu$}m. Here, strong light-matter coupling and hybridisation between the excitonic transition is identified using white-light reflectivity and photoluminescence emission. We use steady-state spectroscopy to demonstrate polariton-mediated energy transfer between such coupled states over ``mesoscopic distances'', with this process being enhanced compared to non-cavity control structures.},

Consistently, energy transfer between exciton states, that is, electron-hole pairs bound by Coulomb interaction, is limited to distances of the order of 10 nm. Here, we demonstrate polariton-mediated coupling and energy transfer between excitonic states over a distance exceeding 2 {$\mu$}m. We accomplish this by coupling quantum well-confined excitons through the delocalized mode of two coupled optical microcavities. Use of magnetically doped quantum wells enables us to tune the confined exciton energy by the magnetic field and in this way to control the spatial direction of the transfer. Such controlled, long-distance interaction between coherently coupled quantum emitters opens possibilities of a scalable implementation of quantum networks and quantum simulators based on solid-state, multi-cavity systems.},

This is nowhere more the case than in the field of intermolecular energy transfer, where polaritonic states formed as a result of strong light\textendash matter interactions have been shown to promote energy transfer over distances vastly exceeding conventional limits. In this review, we provide the reader with a succinct account of the fundamental concepts of intermolecular energy transfer, and how they are modified by strong light\textendash matter interactions. We also summarize recent experimental advances in the area, including in optoelectronic device contexts, and highlight both the potential and challenges that remain in this exciting field of research going forward.},

  abstract = {Strong interactions between excitons and photons lead to the formation of exciton-polaritons, which possess completely different properties compared to their constituents. The polaritons are created by incorporating a material in an optical cavity where the electromagnetic field is tightly confined. Over the last few years, the relaxation of polaritonic states has been shown to enable a new kind of energy transfer event, which is efficient at length scales substantially larger than the typical F\"orster radius. However, the importance of such energy transfer depends on the ability of the short-lived polaritonic states to efficiently decay to molecular localized states that can perform a photochemical process, such as charge transfer or triplet states. Here, we investigate quantitatively the interaction between polaritons and triplet states of erythrosine B in the strong coupling regime. We analyze the experimental data, collected mainly employing angle-resolved reflectivity and excitation measurements, using a rate equation model. We show that the rate of intersystem crossing from the polariton to the triplet states depends on the energy alignment of the excited polaritonic states. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the rate of intersystem crossing can be substantially enhanced in the strong coupling regime to the point where it approaches the rate of the radiative decay of the polariton. In light of the opportunities that transitions from polaritonic to molecular localized states offer within molecular photophysics/chemistry and organic electronics, we hope that the quantitative understanding of such interactions gained from this study will aid in the development of polariton-empowered devices.},

Placing the layer at the cavity field maximum affords an interaction energy (Rabi splitting) of 503 meV, a 62\% increase over that observed if the aggregates are simply spread evenly through the cavity, placing the system in the ultrastrong coupling regime. The fluorescence quantum yield of the lowest polaritonic state P\textendash{} integrated over k-space is found to be {$\sim$}10\textendash 2. The same value can be deduced from the 1.4 ps lifetime of P\textendash{} measured by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and the calculated radiative decay rate constant. Thus, the polariton decay is dominated by nonradiative processes, in contrast with what might be expected from the small effective mass of the polaritons. These findings provide a deeper understanding of hybrid light-molecule states and have implications for the modification of molecular and material properties by strong coupling.},

The results of concentration quenching and depolarization agree with the hopping theory of forward energy transport up to intermediate concentrations. At the highest concentrations, the experimental quantum yield is higher than the theoretical one and no repolarization effect is found at room temperature. These discrepancies are explained by the formation of fluorescent dimers which are imperfect traps for excitation energy. This conclusion is supported by measurements at elevated temperature.},

@article{Scully_PNASUSA2011a,
	abstract = {Laser and photocell quantum heat engines (QHEs) are powered by thermal light and governed by the laws of quantum thermodynamics. To appreciate the deep connection between quantum mechanics and thermodynamics we need only recall that in 1901 Planck introduced the quantum of action to calculate the entropy of thermal light, and in 1905 Einstein's studies of the entropy of thermal light led him to introduce the photon. Then in 1917, he discovered stimulated emission by using detailed balance arguments. Half a century later, Scovil and Schulz-DuBois applied detailed balance ideas to show that maser photons were produced with Carnot quantum efficiency (see Fig. 1A). Furthermore, Shockley and Quiesser invoked detailed balance to obtain the efficiency of a photocell illuminated by "hot" thermal light (see Fig. 2A). To understand this detailed balance limit, we note that in the QHE, the incident light excites electrons, which can then deliver useful work to a load. However, the efficiency is limited by radiative recombination in which the excited electrons are returned to the ground state. But it has been proven that radiatively induced quantum coherence can break detailed balance and yield lasing without inversion. Here we show that noise-induced coherence enables us to break detailed balance and get more power out of a laser or photocell QHE. Surprisingly, this coherence can be induced by the same noisy (thermal) emission and absorption processes that drive the QHE (see Fig. 3A). Furthermore, this noise-induced coherence can be robust against environmental decoherence.Fig. 1.(A) Schematic of a laser pumped by hot photons at temperature T(h) (energy source, blue) and by cold photons at temperature T(c) (entropy sink, red). The laser emits photons (green) such that at threshold the laser photon energy and pump photon energy is related by Carnot efficiency (4). (B) Schematic of atoms inside the cavity. Lower level b is coupled to the excited states a and β. The laser power is governed by the average number of hot and cold thermal photons, and . (C) Same as B but lower b level is replaced by two states b(1) and b(2), which can double the power when there is coherence between the levels.Fig. 2.(A) Schematic of a photocell consisting of quantum dots sandwiched between p and n doped semiconductors. Open circuit voltage and solar photon energy ℏν(h) are related by the Carnot efficiency factor where T(c) is the ambient and T(h) is the solar temperature. (B) Schematic of a quantum dot solar cell in which state b is coupled to a via, e.g., solar radiation and coupled to the valence band reservoir state β via optical phonons. The electrons in conduction band reservoir state α pass to state β via an external circuit, which contains the load. (C) Same as B but lower level b is replaced by two states b(1) and b(2), and when coherently prepared can double the output power.Fig. 3.(A) Photocell current j = Γρ(αα) (laser photon flux P(l)/ℏ(ν(l))) (in arbitrary units) generated by the photovoltaic cell QHE (laser QHE) of Fig. 1C (Fig. 2C) as a function of maximum work (in electron volts) done by electron (laser photon) E(α) - E(β) + kT(c) log(ρ(αα)/ρ(ββ)) with full (red line), partial (brown line), and no quantum interference (blue line). (B) Power of a photocell of Fig. 2C as a function of voltage for different decoherence rates , 100γ(1c). Upper curve indicates power acquired from the sun.},

@article{Gross_PR1982a,
	abstract = {This essay presents a theoretical description of the superradiance phenomenon, in which both the quantal and the classical aspects are discussed. Starting from the simple two-level atom-small sample Dicke model, we successively introduce various complications inherent to a realistic superradiance experiment: effects of Van der Waals interaction between the atoms, propagation and diffraction of the electromagnetic field in the sample and finally the effects related to atomic level degeneracy or near degeneracy. We recall how to calculate the field radiated by a superradiant system in a single experiment and how to determine, for a series of identically prepared superradiant samples, the large shot to shot fluctuations of the emitted light properties. The presentation tries to unify various points of view and formalisms developed in previous works and to introduce simply and progressively the basic physical concepts relevant to the superradiance phenomenon.},
